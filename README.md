# Georgia Tech Student Foundation
The Georgia Tech Student Foundation is the largest student-run philanthropic endowment in the nation, and one of their annual events is Gift to Tech. Campus organizations will submit ideas for projects they are interested in materializing, and the Student Foundation will host an election for the winning project. The winner will receive ~$30,000 to use for their project. Elections have previously been done in two rounds of simple majority votes. The first round would narrow the candidates down to the top 3 favorite and the second would get us down to the top project. Due to the inherent flaws of simple majority elections, the Student Foundation decided to try a single transferable vote election, which you can read more about [here](https://www.britannica.com/topic/single-transferable-vote).

This application was made to help the Georgia Tech Student Foundation determine the results of a single transferable vote election for Gift to Tech. Due to the strange way the csv was laid out, the code (which is inside the Jupyter Notebook), had to be written in a very specific way, so it is not easily-generalizable. It is also written sub-optimally, as I tried to make very incremental steps and explain each in detail so that a person with a non-technical background could follow the effects of the code.
